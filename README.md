Sorting Spectra ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ 
Welcome to Sorting Spectra! This project is a sorting visualization tool implemented in C++ that demonstrates various sorting algorithms in an interactive and visually engaging way. Users can watch how different sorting algorithms work and understand the sorting process through colorful visualizations.

Features
Visual Representation: Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms with color-coded outputs.
Sorting Algorithms: Includes Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Counting Sort.
Interactive Menu: Users can choose from different sorting algorithms and visualize the sorting process.
Color Coding: Distinguishes between unsorted and sorted parts of the array using ANSI color codes.
Algorithms Included
Bubble Sort: Simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.

Selection Sort: Iteratively selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item from the input data and inserting it into the correct position.

Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element, partitions the array into elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.

Heap Sort: Converts the array into a heap data structure and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and reconstructs the heap until the array is sorted.

Counting Sort: Non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that counts the occurrences of each distinct element and places them in their correct positions.
